# Registry-Debug

### How it works
Lists Registry strings to a read-only textbox. These strings are randomized every 5 minutes, so the application may be buggy.

This is mainly a joke program, any antimalware warning is a false positive. The webhook does not exist, nor do the strings, so don't worry about your PC getting messed up.
